# EJ Second Edition Exercises
My attempts and notes for the examples found in Eloquent Javascript - 2nd Edition

These examples are early on learning javascript so I take my own knowledge as far as I can and then reference the authors solutions. In some cases I've got A solution, but not HIS solution - so I copy his and make notes explaining what's happening so I can better understand. 

I've since stopped with this book in favor of exercising my newly found knowledge. Several blogs/online forums suggest going beyond chapter 4 with little experience is going to prove impossible. (quickly illustated after reading chapter 5). I've begun seaking out other exercises to practice and reading through [Kyle Simpson's] (https://github.com/getify) ['You Don't Know Javascript'] (https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) repo on github.
